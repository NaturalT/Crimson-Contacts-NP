Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have created a login page and a register page, as well as an SQL database that has capacity for the "home address" of users in the form of coordinates.
I decided to use coordinates instead of addresses because that way I have a way to ensure accuracy of location. If the address is not registered by the location service and coordinates are not
obtained, I'll know to ask again for a working address. I have done research into API's and decided to use google maps. I have constructed a survey consisting of 3 questions for users to take every day, and have made a survey page as well.
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to implement the API into the register and Survey pages so users can provide their exact coordinates just by providing an address.
I have to learn how to make pop ups that redirect users and automated notifications to remind users to complete their surveys every day. I have not found a way yet to cross reference SQL lists each time a user fills out their survey.
I have not figured out my aesthetic or color scheme of my website.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Right now I am trying to figure out how to initiate a process when a user fills out a survey that will compare the newly submitted results to the survey automatically, but only if the responses in the survey are verified true or not invalid.
I am working with event listeners for this. Also implementing API's is proving rather difficult, as there is different functionality between static and dynamic API. Thankfully google has address based geocoding software available and theirs is rather easy to use.
